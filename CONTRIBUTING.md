   please open a new issue
   to discuss your proposed changes.
2. Avoid duplicating work by commenting on the issue you're working on and feel free to seek assistance or ask
   questions; our team is happy to help.
3. Fork the repository and create a new branch from `main`. To develop, please follow the setup instructions below.
4. Implement your changes and commit them to your branch.
5. When you feel ready, open a pull request with your changes. You can also open the PR as a draft to receive early
   feedback. To facilitate the review process, we have provided a PR checklist below.
6. Our team will review your pull request and provide feedback. Once everything looks good, we will proceed to merge
   your contribution.

## Setting up your development environment

Follow the instructions in [README](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-llmstudio/blob/main/README.md) to set up your
environment. Run `make setup-dev` instead of `make setup` to install the development dependencies.

## Running linters and tests

Before submitting your pull request, ensure that your code passes the linters and tests.
To format your code, run `make format`. You can check for any style issues by running `make style`. To run the tests,
run `make test`.

## PR checklist

Please make sure your pull request fulfills the following checklist:

☐ The PR title should provide a clear summary of your contribution.  
☐ Link the related issue (e.g., closes #123) in your PR description.  
☐ If your contribution is still a work in progress, change the PR to draft mode.  
☐ Ensure that the existing tests pass by running `make test`.  
☐ Make sure `make style` passes to maintain consistent code style.  

## Installing custom packages

If you need to install additional Python packages into the environment, you can do so using pip after activating your virtual environment via ```make shell```. For example, to install flash-attention, you would use the following commands:

```bash
make shell
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
pip install git+https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention.git#subdirectory=csrc/rotary
```

For a PR, update the pyproject.toml and the uv.lock via ```uv add package_name```.
