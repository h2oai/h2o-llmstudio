Enables Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) to be used instead of low rank approximations (LoRA) during training. This parameter efficient training method is build on top of LoRA and has shown promising results. Especially at lower ranks (e.g. r=4), it is expected to perform superior to LoRA.
