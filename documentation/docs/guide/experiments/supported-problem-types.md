# Supported problem types

## Overview

H2O LLM Studio supports various problem types that allow users to fine-tune models for different tasks. The five supported problem types are explained below.

## Causal language modeling 

- **Description:** Causal language modeling predicts the next token in a sequence of tokens. The model only sees what has come before (i.e., the left side of the sequence) and must guess what comes next. Frequently used for text generation.

## Causal classification modeling

- **Description:** 

## Causal regression modeling

- **Description:** 

## Sequence to sequence modeling

- **Description:** A type of machine learning architecture designed to transform one sequence into another. It is commonly used for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition.

## Dpo modeling

- **Description:**
